## 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. **Runtime Error in Community Property Calculations**
**Impact: Application crashes during quasi-community property processing**

**Issue**: Missing `STATE_INFO` import in `/src/utils/calculations.ts:57`
```typescript
// ERROR: STATE_INFO is referenced but not imported
const currentJurisdictionInfo = STATE_INFO[jurisdiction];
```

**Required Fix**:
```typescript
import { isCommunityPropertyState, STATE_INFO } from './states';
```

### 2. **Incomplete State-Specific Legal Rules**
**Impact: Legally inaccurate calculations for multiple states**

**Community Property States (9)**:
- ✅ **Texas**: Properly implemented
- ⚠️ **California**: Missing putative spouse doctrine
- 🚨 **Louisiana**: Civil law concepts not handled
- ⚠️ **Nevada**: Economic fault provisions missing

**Equitable Distribution States (41 + DC)**:
- 🚨 **All states use identical algorithm** - No state differentiation
- ⚠️ **Pennsylvania only** gets enhanced factors
- 🚨 **Missing state-specific precedents** and factor weighting

### 3. **Missing Critical Privacy Compliance Features**
**Impact: GDPR and CCPA violations**

**Critical Gaps**:
- ❌ No privacy policy or consent management
- ❌ No cookie consent banner
- ❌ No data portability API (Right to Access)
- ❌ No user privacy dashboard
- ❌ No legal basis tracking for data processing

### 4. **Incomplete Document Template System**
**Impact: Document generation failures**

**Missing Files**:
- ❌ `/templates/msa_template.docx` (referenced in code but doesn't exist)
- ❌ Financial affidavit templates (API references but no implementation)
- ⚠️ State-specific template variations needed

---

## ✅ Strengths & Positive Findings

### **Excellent Security Infrastructure**
