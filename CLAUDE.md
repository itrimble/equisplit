- **Special Handling**: Income from separate property, quasi-community property

#### Equitable Distribution States (41 + DC)
- **Factors Considered**: Marriage length, age, health, contributions, tax implications
- **Calculation Range**: 40/60 to 50/50 based on marriage duration and circumstances

### Document Standards

```typescript
interface CourtDocument {
  format: 'pdf' | 'docx';
  jurisdiction: USState;
  signatures: {
    required: boolean;
    type: 'wet' | 'electronic';
    notarization: boolean;
  };
  retention: {
    period: number; // years
    purpose: 'legal' | 'tax' | 'audit';
  };
}
```

### UPL (Unauthorized Practice of Law) Safeguards

- Information vs. advice distinction
- User retains all decision-making authority
- No document interpretation or legal recommendations
